nominal.m is the model file describing the equations and nominal system for the SCN-HPA axis model used to simulate resultes published in Li et al. (Light entrainment of the suprachiasmatic nucleus circadian clock and implications for personalized alterations of corticosterone rhythms in shift work and jet lag).

properties_calculation.m is the model file showing the generation of simulated individuals and their properties under perturbed jet lag and shift work.

plot_properties.m is the file to plot the properties calculated from properties_cuaculation.m

actogram_yl.m is a function file to plot actograms in the paper

arnold_onion.m is the file to plot arnold onions and their area differences as function of coupling parameters

five_component_jet_lag is the file to calculate and plot the resynchronization time for five components among all the simulated individuals

.txt files inculde the coupling strengths for the simulated individuals and their properties under jet lag and shift work schedules. They are used to plot figures in plot_properties.m
